Travel Blog with Semantic HTML5 and Accessibility üåç‚úàÔ∏è

About This Project
This project is a multi-page travel blog that demonstrates the use of semantic HTML5 elements and incorporates accessibility best practices. The goal is to create a well-structured website that provides accessible content and follows HTML5 guidelines for proper page structure. The blog consists of four main pages: Homepage, Destinations, Travel Tips, and Gallery.  

Features

1. Homepage (index.html)
- The homepage uses semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.  
- A navigation bar is included with links to the other pages: Destinations, Travel Tips, and Gallery.  
- The homepage contains a welcoming message inside a `<section>` element.  
- An image with descriptive alt text is included, appropriate for the travel theme.

2. Destinations Page (destinations.html)
- The content is structured using semantic elements, with each destination being placed inside an `<article>` element.  
- At least three destinations are included, each with its own `<article>`, a heading `<h2>`, a description, and an image with descriptive alt text.  
- A "Read More" link is included for each destination (though no detailed pages are created for this lab).  

3. Travel Tips Page (tips.html)
- The page includes a list of at least five travel tips, with appropriate use of `<section>` and `<aside>`.  
- Images related to the tips include descriptive **alt text**.  
- The page uses proper heading levels:  
  - `<h1>` for the title,  
  - `<h2>` for section titles, and  
  - `<h3>` for individual tips.

4. Gallery Page (gallery.html)**  
- The gallery is created using semantic elements such as `<section>` and `<figure>`.  
- At least six travel-related images are displayed, each with a caption inside the `<figcaption>` element.  
- All images have **alt text**, and the layout is visually appealing for readability.

5. Footer (applies to all pages) 
- The footer includes contact information and social media links.  
- Accessible icons with alt text are used for social media links.  

Additional Guidelines 
- Images: Each page contains at least one relevant image with descriptive alt text.  
- Accessibility: All images have alt text, and each section of the page has clear, accessible headings for a well-structured HTML layout.  
- Navigation: The navigation is consistent across all pages for smooth user experience.  
- Style: Basic styling is applied, but the focus is on HTML structure and accessibility rather than CSS.
